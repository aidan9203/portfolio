This is my final project for my graphics course at the University of Utah. It is a short game where the player jumps between obstacles to get to the finish flag. There are checkpoints along the way that the player can touch so that they will be respawned there if they fall. The player can move with WASD, jump with the space bar, and look around by moving the mouse. The player can ride on walls to cross large gaps and can jump off to other walls or platforms when wall riding. The game can be launced using the "GAME.exe" executable or in x64 Debug mode through Visual Studio.

The game was made with OpenGL using the Freeglut and OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) libraries. The purpose of the project was to learn how to render multiple 3D models in OpenGL, how to texture these models using UVs, and how to raycast against these models for collision detection.
