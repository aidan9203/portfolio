This portfolio contains examples of work I have done while developing my skills in programming, 3D modeling, and game design. Many of the folders have README files like this one that give a short explaination for my motivation behind each project and give some details about how the project was implemented.

Out of all the projects I have included, the following four are my favorites:

My virtual reality project Apollo (located in the "virtual reality" folder) is my favorite project to date. It is my workspace for experimenting with virtual reality controls and game mechanics. I am in the process of using it to discover what features suit virtual reality platforms well and how such features can be implemented.

My OpenGL project for my graphics class (located in the "opengl" folder) was the most challenging project I have worked on. The goal of the project was to use OpenGL to render textured 3D objects in a simple game. It was my first experience with OpenGL and figuring out how to use OpenGL's buffer system for multiple textured objects was quite the challenge.

My winter level showcase (located in "models/low_poly_environment") is another Unity project of mine where I have created a winter snowscape to explore including a frozen river and hidden tunnel network. It is more of a low-poly showcase than a game, but it has helped me to visualize my models more than a 3D modeling program can.

SpaceWars was a partner project where we implemented concurrent networking between a server (located in "spacewars/Server") and multiple clients (located in "spacewars/Client"). It is a multiplayer asteroids-like game with the intention of introducing us to network programming and 2D rendering outside of an engine.
