This portfolio contains examples of work I have done while developing my skills in programming, 3D modeling, and game design. Many of the folders have README files like this one that give a short explaination for my motivation behind each project and give some details about how the project was implemented.

Out of all the projects I have included, the following three are my favorites:

My virtual reality project Apollo (located in the "virtual reality" folder) is my favorite project to date. It is my workspace for experimenting with virtual reality controls and game mechanics. I am in the process of using it to discover what features suit virtual reality platforms well and how such features can be implemented.

My winter level showcase (located in "models/low_poly_environment") is another Unity project of mine where I have created a winter snowscape to explore including a frozen river and hidden tunnel network. It is more of a low-poly showcase than a game, but it has helped me to visualize my models more than a 3D modeling program can.

SpaceWars was a partner project where we implemented concurrent networking between a server (located in "spacewars/Server") and multiple clients (located in "spacewars/Client"). It is a multiplayer asteroids-like game with the intention of introducing us to network programming and 2D rendering outside of an engine.
