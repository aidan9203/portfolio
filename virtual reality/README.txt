Apollo is a work in progress Unity VR showcase I am using to practice game development in virtual reality. The primary purpose of the project is to develop basic features such as interacting with items or climbing and then perfect them as I experiment.

At the moment the game has a moon surface that can be explored with a mysterious floating rock pit, a lunar lander, a crashed capsule, and an abandoned space station.

There are items, doors, and containers that can be interacted with using the triggers and a rover in the storage compartment of the lander that can be assembled and driven.

The player can move around the world by moving within their playspace or by jumping with the menu button on either controller. The player can also climb rocks and ladders with the triggers.

The game was developed using a Windows Mixed Reality headset but should still be compatable with Vive or Occulus (although untested).
